# Testing the Consent Identity Service

We make use of the [Dapple VM test harness](https://github.com/nexusdev/dapple) to run basic unit tests on the [registry](../src/sol/didm-registry.sol) and [did contracts](../src/sol/cnsnt-did.sol).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install -g dapple solc
```

## Running

```bash
$ npm test
```

> Please note that these tests take 2-3 minutes to finish â€”Â it might seem like the tests hang on the compilation step. The order in which the tests run aren't guaranteed.

It should return the following text:

```bash
> consent-ethereum-identity-service@0.2.0 test
> npm run --silent test:contracts
